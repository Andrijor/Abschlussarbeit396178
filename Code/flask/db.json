More details: There are different ML categories and it works differently based on its learning type. Machine learning can be unsupervised, supervised, or based on reinforcement. Supervised learning uses classified datasets to teach the model how to classify new data. Unsupervised learning tries to find patterns within the given data. Reinforcement learning works via trial-and-error improvement based on actions and rewards. Deep learning is part of machine learning. Deep learning is machine learning that uses algorithms and structures that imitate the architecture of the brain. An example of deep learning is using structures called neural networks. It is called deep because there are many layers within the neural network architecture. An example of machine learning is the perceptron. The perceptron is a program used for machine learning and it is based on a single neuron. A perceptron, it learns to classify data in two categories like red or blue. A neural network is made of multiple perceptrons connected to each other.",

AI is closely related to NLP because of its goal. The main goal of NLP is achieving a human-like level of language. NLP can be separated into natural language understanding and natural language generation. Natural language understanding receives human language and gives it a structure that computers can understand and interpret. In natural language generation a program uses computer language models to create language that people can understand. NLP can be used for auto-correcting spelling mistakes, language translation and chatbots.",

The chatbot's goals can be task-oriented or non-task-oriented. A task-oriented chatbot is made for a particular task. A non-task-oriented chatbot is made to simulate a general conversation. A chatbot's design can be rule-based, retrieval-based, or generative. A rule-based chatbot requires mostly hand-made templates to be able to respond. A retrieval-based chatbot uses deep learning to extract a response from a knowledge database. A generative chatbot is able to produce text responses on its own by using neural network models.",

                "context": "Transformers are an Encoder-Decoder model. An encoder, it is the component that initially takes an input text (usually a sentence) and transforms it. A decoder is the component that reads the encoded data and predicts a sequence of words. This decoded sequence could be a language translation or a response to a question. Step 1: Everything starts by utilizing a word embedding. A word embedding is a mapping of words in a vector space. A mapping is something like a word-to-vector dictionary. Step 2: All these word vectors are then assigned positional data based on where they are in the sentence. Step 3: The input is encoded through a layer of self-attention. What happens within self-attention is a comparison of each word with all of the others in the sentence. This comparison calculates how relevant a word's meaning is in relation to another single word. Step 4: Each newly calculated vector gets transformed further and normalized to simplify future calculations. Step 5:The now transformed data gets sent to the decoder. Step 6: The decoder receives an embedding based on what its target goal is. Step 7: the vectors from the embedding receive positional data. Step 8: The decoder embedding passes through a masked attention layer. Step 9: The data passes through a second attention layer together with the encoded data. Step 10: The data gets normalized. Step 11: The data gets made into a probability vector for the next most likely word. Step 12: The output word gets used as an input to continue the sequence until it finishes.",

                "context": "My name is Chatot. I teach this course. A chatbot is an AI program. This course is about learning what chatbots are and how they are made. I don't have thoughts or feelings. AI is a broad field of computer science. AI tries incorporates human intelligence into computer programs. AI works by following specific rules and algorithms, like generalized strategies. An example of AI is the minimax algorithm. Minimax tries to find the optimal move for a player in a two-player game. The minimax algorithm is used in chess, go and tic-tac-toe! Machine learning is a form of implementing AI. Machine learning is a technique used to make programs improve and learn from data. More details: There are different ML categories and it works differently based on its learning type. Machine learning can be unsupervised, supervised, or based on reinforcement. Supervised learning uses classified datasets to teach the model how to recognize new data. Unsupervised learning tries to find patterns within the given data. Reinforcement learning works via trial-and-error improvement based on actions and rewards. Deep learning is part of machine learning. Deep learning is machine learning that uses algorithms and structures that imitate the architecture of the brain. An example of deep learning is using structures called neural networks. It is called deep because there are many layers within the neural network architecture. An example of machine learning is the perceptron. The perceptron is a program used for machine learning and it is based on a single neuron. A perceptron, it learns to classify data in two categories like red or blue. A neural network is made of multiple perceptrons connected to each other. NLP is the same as natural language processing. NLP is a computer-based approach to analyzing text based on a set of linguistic theories. AI is closely related to NLP because of its goal. The main goal of NLP is achieving a human-like level of language. NLP can be separated into natural language understanding and natural language generation. Natural language understanding receives human language and gives it a structure that computers can understand and interpret. In natural language generation a program uses computer language models to create language that people can understand. NLP can be used for auto-correcting spelling mistakes, language translation and chatbots. Sentiment analysis is an application of NLP that tries to measure how positive or negative a text is. Sentiment analysis, it uses many examples to classify how emotionally charged a sentence or a paragraph is. Sentiment analysis without machine learning would try to detect keywords or patterns that might influence the emotional score. A weakness of sentiment analysis is human language's complexity and context dependency. An example of this complexity is sarcasm being detected wrongly.Eliza is a chatbot that acts like a psychotherapist. Eliza formulates clever sentences that allow the user to just keep talking. ALICE is a chatbot that won the Loebner price three times. ALICE works by using special tags (AIML) that allows bots to recognize patterns. AIML is a markup language that helps to simplify pattern detection in input texts. These two bots are examples or kinds of rule-based chatbots, that means they are chatbots made by writing all its responses/response patterns by hand. Interaction modality classifies chatbots as (written) text-based or speech-based. A chatbot's knowledge domain can be open or closed domain. An open domain means the chatbot tries to understand and talk about any topic it's given. A closed domain means the chatbot can only talk about a specific subject. The chatbot's goals can be task-oriented or non-task-oriented. A task-oriented chatbot is made for a particular task. A non-task-oriented chatbot is made to simulate a general conversation. A chatbot's design can be rule-based, retrieval-based, or generative. A rule-based chatbot requires mostly hand-made templates to be able to respond. A retrieval-based chatbot uses deep learning to extract a response from a knowledge database. A generative chatbot is able to produce text responses on its own by using neural network models. Vectorization entails transforming plain text into a numerical representation. Vectors can be created from whole texts, sentences or single words. The goal of vectorization is creating vectors that are similar when the meaning of their content is similar as well. The condition to vectorize text is that it should be tokenized. Tokenization means splitting the text into smaller units like words. Tokenization is good in the sense that it makes plain text easier to understand for the computer. The bad part of tokenization is that the single tokens don't necessarily carry much meaning within them. Transformers are an Encoder-Decoder model. An encoder, it is the component that initially takes an input text (usually a sentence) and transforms it. A decoder is the component that reads the encoded data and predicts a sequence of words. This decoded sequence could be a language translation or a response to a question. Step 1: Everything starts by utilizing a word embedding. A word embedding is a mapping of words in a vector space. A mapping is something like a word-to-vector dictionary. Step 2: All these word vectors are then assigned positional data based on where they are in the sentence. Step 3: The input is encoded through a layer of self-attention. What happens within self-attention is a comparison of each word with all of the others in the sentence. This comparison calculates how relevant a word's meaning is in relation to another single word. Step 4: Each newly calculated vector gets transformed further and normalized to simplify future calculations. Step 5:The now transformed data gets sent to the decoder. Step 6: The decoder receives an embedding based on what its target goal is. Step 7: the vectors from the embedding receive positional data. Step 8: The decoder embedding passes through a masked attention layer. Step 9: The data passes through a second attention layer together with the encoded data. Step 10: The data gets normalized. Step 11: The data gets made into a probability vector for the next most likely word. Step 12: The output word gets used as an input to continue the sequence until it finishes. Some pros include that the chatbot model understands questions and the context without specific programming. A con of the chatbot model is that it might not be able to respond to a question when the context is too complex. The chatbot model can be classified as retrieval-based and task-oriented in a closed domain. The chatbot model got trained in question answering with a dataset called SQuAD 2.0. This dataset contains 150k example questions and answers. To play the simulation, type \\simulation."
